# ML-Projects


Since 2019, based on my sheer interest and professional requirement to lead the Python & AI/ML team to solve complex business requirement, I started exploring into AI/ML & Data Science.

As and when I can spend time, I started playing around with the codes and build various solutions.
Python was my goto approach, as I was using Python since 2018. Panda, Numpy, Spacy, are all in my playground And I am really enjoying it.....

I primarily uses Google Colab, that provides us the prebuilt computimg powewr with GPU's and a customized Jupiter Notebook. Google Colab has really made my life easy, as instead of spending time on getting the environment ready for my projects, I just need to focus on my codes and outcomes.
